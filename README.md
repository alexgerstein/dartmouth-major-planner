Webapp for Dartmouth students to plan their courses for their time at Dartmouth. Instead of individually looking up the courses that you want to take and checking for conflicts. The app scrapes all course catalogue pages and provides a simple interface to drag and drop the classes you want to take into the terms that you can take them.

Currently at [dartplan.com](dartplan.com). DartmouthID required.
