Hey {{user.nickname.split(" ")[0]}},

It doesn't look like {{offering}} is being offered as a {{hour}} during {{term}} anymore. On the bright side, it seems to be a {{new_offering.get_hour()}}. We made this switch for you, but you might want to check that the new time does not conflict with your other classes.

Find your options at dartplan.com.
