<p>Hey {{user.nickname.split(" ")[0]}},</p>

<p>It doesn't look like {{old_offering}} is being offered as a {{old_offering.hour}} during {{old_offering.term}} anymore. On the bright side, it seems to be a {{new_offering.hour}}. We made this switch for you, but you might want to check that the new time does not conflict with your other classes.</p>

<p>Find your options at <a href="www.dartplan.com">dartplan.com</a>.</p>

<p>Regards,</p>
